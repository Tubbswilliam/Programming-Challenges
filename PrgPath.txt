turn based games
two player games
perfect information games(both players play optimally)

////Summary /////
Rules for turn-based perfect information two-player games;
->The base winning or losing states are defined by the problem.
->A state is a winning state if there exists at least one losing state reachable 
from this state.
->A state is a losing state if all it's reachable states are winning states.
->if there are states remaining which do not fir these three conditons then that
state correspond to a draw.
